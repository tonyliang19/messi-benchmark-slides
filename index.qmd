## Multiomics Integration and Existing problem

Profiling of different molecular measurements (i.e. genes, proteins, metabolites) from same biological samples.


<!--- Change color for this --->
::: {.callout-tip}

# Motivation

- Multiomics is a new emerging field of study --> How to levarage it?

- Many integration methods --> Which to use and under what circumstances?
<!-- - "Gap" between biologists and computer-based multiomics methods. -->

- Reproducibility crisis --> How to reproduce method and get reliable results?

:::

<!---- 

Fix this point of solution, make a more concrete and summarized 
note point for audiences

Make incremental as  well
---->

Solution:

- Propose a systematic workflow to benchmark (measure) these methods with a lot of datasets.

<!-- ::: {.callout-note}

- Which method to choose? 
- How to interpret the results?
- How to reproduce these and present to your labmates?

## Overview of MESSI-benchmark

::: {.callout-note}

This slide should have the figure for what is doing of the pipeline


- Add key points of why pipeline is good, and what usage
