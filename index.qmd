# Motivation

- Technological advancement and reduced costs --> studies with multiomics data

- Multiomics data --> bulk/single-cell/spatial data

- More generalized --> "multimodal data", other non-omics data

- Types of integrations: by sample (N), by omics (P), or both

## Multiomics data integration methods



![](assets/methods_avail.jpg)

- Many integration methods --> Which to use, how to choose them?
<!-- - "Gap" between biologists and computer-based multiomics methods. -->

- Reproducibility crisis --> How to reproduce method and get reliable results?

- Existing benchmark studies are not 100% complete or all-encompassing

- Generalizable for more integration methods

- Data transformable for Python or R based methods

- Reproducible workflow, results/findings

- Setup easily through nf-core^[@ewels2020nf]

- Help to develop new integration method

- Compare large set of independent data at once
